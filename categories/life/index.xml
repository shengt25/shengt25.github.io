        <title>My First Blog Post</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Q: Why creating my own blog? ðŸ¤”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: I want a place to record my learning and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who likes collecting and backing up, I always want to record the learning process and the challenges I encounter along the way. Plus, if it can help someone else, that would be even better. But it&amp;rsquo;s already 2024, and blogging seems a bit &amp;ldquo;retro.&amp;rdquo; Why not use other social platforms? One reason is passion and sentiment, which tech folks might understand haha. Another is the peace of mindâ€”writing down trivial notes without getting involved in the noise of social platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as someone who is a bit of a perfectionist (and not great at writing), starting a blog is always challenging: I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about it more than once, started a little, and then never continued. This time, I&amp;rsquo;m also &amp;ldquo;pushing&amp;rdquo; myself a bit. No matter what I write or how it turns out, Iâ€™ll just start. At least it&amp;rsquo;s recorded, and I can improve it later, right? Instead of always preparing, focusing on minor details, refining, refining, refining, and then giving up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a comic I saw some time ago &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;, which is exactly the mindset I need to learn. Start with a prototype that works, then iterate!&lt;/p&gt;
