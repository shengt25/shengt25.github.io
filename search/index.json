[{"content":"Q: Why creating my own blog? ðŸ¤”\nA: I want a place to record my learning and thoughts.\nAs someone who likes collecting and backing up, I always want to record the learning process and the challenges I encounter along the way. Plus, if it can help someone else, that would be even better. But it\u0026rsquo;s already 2024, and blogging seems a bit \u0026ldquo;retro.\u0026rdquo; Why not use other social platforms? One reason is passion and sentiment, which tech folks might understand haha. Another is the peace of mindâ€”writing down trivial notes without getting involved in the noise of social platforms.\nAlso, as someone who is a bit of a perfectionist (and not great at writing), starting a blog is always challenging: I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about it more than once, started a little, and then never continued. This time, I\u0026rsquo;m also \u0026ldquo;pushing\u0026rdquo; myself a bit. No matter what I write or how it turns out, Iâ€™ll just start. At least it\u0026rsquo;s recorded, and I can improve it later, right? Instead of always preparing, focusing on minor details, refining, refining, refining, and then giving up.\nI remember a comic I saw some time ago [1], which is exactly the mindset I need to learn. Start with a prototype that works, then iterate!\n","date":"2024-09-21T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/my-first-blog-post/","title":"My First Blog Post"}]
